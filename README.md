# Learning Data Science

This repository contains my practice notebooks as I begin my journey in **Python** and **Math** for Data Science.  
It includes basics, exercises, and small projects as I build my skills step by step.

## Structure
- `python/` â†’ basics: loops, functions, pandas
- `math/` â†’ statistics, probability, linear algebra
- `projects/` â†’ mini projects (when something is polished)
- `data/` â†’ sample datasets (small only)
